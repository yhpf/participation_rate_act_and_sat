# Participation rate ACT and SAT 


---

### Overview
This project was done as a first project at the Data Science Immersive Program at GA.
Prior to this project we had gone over some basic statistics, learned some Python programming concepts, and also learned how to navigate files, packages, and libraries using the command line. 

In this project I look at SAT and ACT scores around the United States. The main focus will be on Standardized Testing, Statistical Summaries and Inference.

### Goals
- Describe your data with visualizations & statistical analysis in a Jupyter notebook.
- A 5 minute non-technical presentation targeting the ACt board. <BR />
Notebook and pdf of the presentation can be found in this repo.

### About the Jupyter Notebook

- Description of the data
- EDA (visuals in Matplotlib, distribution and relationsships between variables with Numpy)

### Datasets

Two datasets in separet csv-files were used, containing:
- SAT Scores
- ACT Scores

You can see the source for the data here:
SAT data [here](https://blog.prepscholar.com/average-sat-scores-by-state-most-recent)
ACT data [here](https://blog.prepscholar.com/act-scores-by-state-averages-highs-and-lows).

These data give average SAT and ACT scores by state, as well as participation rates, for the graduating class of 2017.
